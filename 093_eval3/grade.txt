Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that cyoa-step1 compiles
rm -f *~ cyoa-step1 cyoa-step2 cyoa-step3 cyoa-step4 cyoa-step1.o cyoa-step2.o cyoa-step3.o cyoa-step4.o
g++ --std=gnu++98 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c cyoa-step1.cpp
g++ -o cyoa-step1 cyoa-step1.o
rm cyoa-step1.o
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step1 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 1
------------------------------------


1.1: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 step1_test/story1 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
Pagenum should be in order.
-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean


1.2: Current test is ./cyoa-step1  < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
Unexpected number of arguments.
-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean


1.3: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 step1_test/story2 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
File open failed.
-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean


1.4: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 step1_test/story3 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean


1.5: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 step1_test/story4 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
Format error.
0@ N:page0.txt-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean


1.6: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 step1_test/story5 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean
No request to check for intermediate deadline completion on step 1

Step 2
Checking that cyoa-step2 compiles
rm -f *~ cyoa-step1 cyoa-step2 cyoa-step3 cyoa-step4 cyoa-step1.o cyoa-step2.o cyoa-step3.o cyoa-step4.o
g++ --std=gnu++98 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c cyoa-step2.cpp
g++ -o cyoa-step2 cyoa-step2.o
rm cyoa-step2.o
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step2 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 2
------------------------------------


2.1: Current test is ./cyoa-step2 step2_test/story1 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
There is no such dest page exists.

-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean


2.2: Current test is ./cyoa-step2 step2_test/story2 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
pages(except 0) should be referenced by at least one other page.
-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean


2.3: Current test is ./cyoa-step2 step2_test/story3 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
There should be at least one Win and Lose page.
-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean
No request to check for intermediate deadline completion on step 2

Step 3
Checking that cyoa-step3 compiles
rm -f *~ cyoa-step1 cyoa-step2 cyoa-step3 cyoa-step4 cyoa-step1.o cyoa-step2.o cyoa-step3.o cyoa-step4.o
g++ --std=gnu++98 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c cyoa-step3.cpp
g++ -o cyoa-step3 cyoa-step3.o
rm cyoa-step3.o
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step3 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 3
------------------------------------


3.1: Current test is ./cyoa-step3 step3_test/story1 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean


3.2: Current test is ./cyoa-step3 step3_test/story2 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean
No request to check for intermediate deadline completion on step 3

Step 4
Checking that cyoa-step4 compiles
rm -f *~ cyoa-step1 cyoa-step2 cyoa-step3 cyoa-step4 cyoa-step1.o cyoa-step2.o cyoa-step3.o cyoa-step4.o
g++ --std=gnu++98 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c cyoa-step4.cpp
g++ -o cyoa-step4 cyoa-step4.o
rm cyoa-step4.o
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step4 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 4
------------------------------------
------------------------------------
You have requested that we check for intermediate deadline completion on step 4
